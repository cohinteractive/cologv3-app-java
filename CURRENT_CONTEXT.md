# CURRENT_CONTEXT.md

## 🛠️ Current Objective

We are working on refining and debugging the UI of the Colog V3 desktop application. The app is mostly functional but several visual and usability issues have emerged, especially after scaling up for larger JSON files and more robust display logic.

Our current focus is **UI bug cleanup**, layout stability, and appearance improvements. These tasks are being addressed iteratively, one issue at a time.

---

## ⚠️ Ongoing Situation

- The application now loads and parses large `.json` files correctly.
- A dark theme has been applied throughout the UI.
- The left panel is intended to show conversations in a fixed-column layout, but:
  - Only the first column ("Index") is currently visible
  - Other columns either do not appear or are mis-sized
  - There are no visible separators
  - No horizontal scrollbar appears to indicate overflow
- More issues still remain and are being worked through sequentially.

## ✅ Most Recent Prompt

> Oh, modify the task 1 prompt to also just display a number for the value in the prompt count column instead of "x9" for example. And aside from the tags column, align text to the left and for tags, to the right.

## ✅ Most Recent Response

> Fix the layout of the left panel conversation list so that each column has a fixed, readable width and aligned content. Also simplify the prompt count formatting.  
> (Followed by detailed implementation instructions for aligning and sizing columns properly)

## 🔁 Next Steps

Further layout issues — including column visibility, spacing, and exchange panel display bugs — will be addressed one by one in a new session. This file is the active context log for continuing that work.
