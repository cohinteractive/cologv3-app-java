# CURRENT_CONTEXT.md

## ðŸ§­ Current Focus

We are implementing the **conversation list display and interaction system** on the left panel of the app interface. This includes rendering a scrollable list of conversation titles with associated metadata (index, timestamp, title), clickable and right-clickable interactions, and visually distinguishing the selected conversation. The selected conversation populates the right panel with its exchanges, and the UI should reflect a modern, minimalistic, and highly navigable interface.

## ðŸ§± Key Work Areas

- Fluid sidebar UI with clear delineation between conversations
- Highlighting and deselection mechanics
- Right-click context menu with stubbed functionality
- Responsive layout: scrollable left index and right exchange view
