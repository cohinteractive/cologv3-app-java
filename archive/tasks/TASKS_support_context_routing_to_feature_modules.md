## ðŸ”€ Context Routing to Feature Modules

These tasks outline how context memory can be directed to the appropriate feature or system destinations.

---

1. **Add metadata fields to ContextMemory entries to associate them with specific features, systems, or modules.**
2. **Design a routing engine that classifies and distributes ContextMemory segments based on this metadata.**
3. **Allow manual override or tagging when auto-routing fails or is ambiguous.**
4. **Write an exporter that organizes context by feature/module and stores it in a structured folder format.**
5. **Document the structure of the routed output for consumption by other agents or viewers.**
