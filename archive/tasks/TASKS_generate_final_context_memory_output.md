## üìù Final Context Memory Output

These tasks define how the final merged memory is produced from processed Exchanges.

---

1. **Define the structure of the final `ContextMemory` output generated after all Exchanges are processed.**
2. **Implement a function that takes the last ContextParcel and produces a finalized memory block.**
3. **Support optional metadata like generation timestamp, source conversation ID, and Exchange count.**
4. **Add annotations for confidence, completeness, or limitations if provided by the LLM.**
5. **Write unit tests that verify correct formatting and data integrity.**
