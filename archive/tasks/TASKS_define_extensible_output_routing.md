1. Implement a router that takes the final ContextMemory and dispatches it to one or more destinations.
2. Destinations include:
   - File system (e.g., save to `context_memory/`)
   - Log summary viewer (optional stub)
   - Documentation generator (placeholder)
   - Error/fix pattern archive (if applicable)
3. Allow configuration of output routing via a settings file or CLI flags.
4. Document how to add a new output target to the system.
