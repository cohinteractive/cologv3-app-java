## 🌐 Export Context to Multiple Views

These tasks define how conversation context can be exported in several formats for different audiences and tooling.

---

1. **Define export formats for:**
   - High-fidelity conversation resume block (Markdown)
   - Human-readable design or feature summary
   - Structured JSON representation for downstream tooling
2. **Create an exporter module with a pluggable output type interface.**
3. **Ensure each view includes a header or footer with metadata and purpose.**
4. **Write export test cases for each format using a sample ContextMemory.**

### 📎 Context
This milestone introduces multiple export views so that context can be reused across documentation and automation workflows.
