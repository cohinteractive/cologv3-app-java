## üóÇÔ∏è Batch Processing with Filters

These tasks outline how to process multiple conversations at once while applying selective filters.

---

1. **Support batch mode that processes all conversations in a given folder or export file.**
2. **Filter which conversations to process using:**
   - Tags
   - Date ranges
   - Conversation title keywords
3. **Store each generated ContextMemory in a structured output directory.**
4. **Log batch summary with stats on processed conversations and output types.**
5. **Handle and report any per-conversation failures gracefully.**
