## üõ†Ô∏è CLI Context Build Runner

These tasks outline a command line tool for building ContextMemory from stored Exchanges.

1. **Implement a CLI entry point to trigger context memory building from a set of Exchanges.**
2. **Support arguments for:**
   - Input file or directory
   - Output format (e.g., markdown, json)
   - Start/end Exchange IDs (optional)
   - Debug mode toggle
3. **Show progress updates as Exchanges are processed.**
4. **Log final memory output location and summary.**
5. **Provide usage instructions and example invocations.**
